# SQL_PROJECT_DATA_ANALYSIS
ðŸ“Š Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores ðŸ’° top-paying jobs, ðŸ”¥ in-demand skills, and ðŸ“ˆ where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

**The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:**
What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

* SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
* PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
* Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:
# 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
```bash
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
